      I build practical automation tools that streamline workflows, improve data quality, 
      and reduce manual effort. My work spans Python scripting, analytics automation, 
      JavaScript bookmarklets, local APIs, and dashboard development.

        <h2>1. Power BI Dashboard</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
        In my quality work, I focused on a data‑driven approach to explore root causes and improve decision‑making.
        Many available data sources were not connected, so I integrated them, built relationships, and created
        visual dashboards to reveal patterns and operational insights. This analytical mindset can be applied
        across sectors such as geoscience, engineering, and other technical fields. Through this process, I
        taught myself Power BI and developed practical skills in data modeling, visualization, and workflow
        automation.
        </p>

        <!-- VIDEO SECTION -->
        <p class="caption">
          This video shows one example from a larger set of Power BI dashboards I developed 
          (over 15 pages in total) to analyze operational and quality data. 
          Sensitive information has been blurred to ensure confidentiality.

        <!-- VIDEO SECTION -->
        <p class="caption"> Demonstration of custom JavaScript bookmarklets I created to automate repetitive 
          data entry tasks. This solution was necessary because no existing extension met the requirements 
          and several tools conflicted with IT security policies.

        <h3>2.2 Python + Local API → Popup Window</h3>
        <p class="caption">
          Example of a local API built with Python to retrieve information from an external 
          database using data extracted from the web application. The results are displayed 
          in a custom popup window for quick review.

        <h3>2.3 Python + API → Full Report (HTML or popup)</h3>
        <p class="caption">
          Full workflow demonstration: the web application sends data to a local Python API, 
          which queries another database, processes the results, and generates a structured 
          report (HTML or popup). This system significantly improved efficiency and reduced 
          manual lookup time.
