    <h2>Phoenix Deposit – Core Logging Interpretation</h2>

<p>
The Phoenix uranium deposit, located within the Wheeler River Project in Saskatchewan’s Athabasca Basin, 
displays a well-defined sequence of sandstone, clay-altered zones, friable mineralized intervals, and 
weathered basement. The core photos below represent the key hydrogeological units encountered in the 
deposit and form the basis for this interpretation.

<h3>Geological Context</h3>
<p>
Phoenix is a classic unconformity-related uranium system. The sequence transitions from Athabasca 
sandstone into progressively stronger clay alteration near the unconformity, followed by friable 
high-grade zones and finally into paleoweathered and competent basement rocks. These units reflect 
fluid flow pathways, redox reactions, and structural preparation that controlled uranium deposition.
</p>

<h3>Interpretation of Hydrogeological Units</h3>

<h4>1. Sandstone Sequence (Units 1a–1b)</h4>
<p>
The upper sandstone units show partial desilicification, faulting, and localized sulfide cementation. 
These features indicate fluid movement through brittle structures and early chemical alteration prior 
to major mineralizing events.
</p>

<h4>2. Clay and Mineralized Zones (Units 2a–2e)</h4>
<p>
This interval marks the transition into the most hydrogeologically active part of the system. 
The upper clay zone (2a) shows strong alteration and reduced competency. The high-grade friable zone (2b) 
is characterized by honeycomb textures, intense clay alteration, and high porosity—features commonly 
associated with uranium-rich fluid pathways. The brown redox zone (2c) represents an oxidation boundary, 
while the sulfide-cemented interval (2d) reflects reducing conditions. The lower clay zone (2e) forms the 
transition into basement rocks.
</p>

<h4>3. Basement Sequence (Units 3a–3b)</h4>
<p>
The paleoweathered basement (3a) shows softened textures and increased porosity, indicating deep 
weathering prior to burial. Beneath it, the competent basement (3b) marks the return to unaltered 
crystalline rock. These units are critical for understanding structural preparation and the geometry 
of mineralizing fluids at the unconformity.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
Together, these units illustrate the vertical evolution of alteration, permeability, and redox 
conditions that control uranium deposition at Phoenix. The combination of friable textures, clay 
alteration, and redox contrasts provides a strong geological framework for interpreting core images 
from any unconformity-related uranium system.
